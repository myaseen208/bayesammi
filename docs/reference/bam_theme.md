# ggplot2 theme of bayesammi

The theme used by every
[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) method of
bayesammi (identical in all packages of the author):
[`theme_classic`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)
with a serif font, black axis lines, ticks pointing inwards and no grid,
close to the look of TikZ/pgfplots figures in LaTeX documents. The
[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) methods also
use `scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)` on every continuous axis. Save
figures with
[`bam_save`](https://myaseen208.com/bayesammi/reference/bam_save.md).

## Usage

``` r
bam_theme(
  base_size = 11,
  base_family = "serif",
  ticks_inward = TRUE,
  legend_position = "bottom"
)
```

## Arguments

- base_size:

  base font size in points (default 11).

- base_family:

  font family (default `"serif"`; for example `"Latin Modern Roman"`
  when installed, to match LaTeX documents).

- ticks_inward:

  logical; ticks point into the panel, as in pgfplots (default `TRUE`).

- legend_position:

  position of the legend (default `"bottom"`).

## Value

A `ggplot2` theme.
